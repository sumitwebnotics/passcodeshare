          <h4>What is Passcode Share?</h4>
          <p>Passcode Share is a secure platform for sending one-time, self-destructing links containing sensitive data like passwords, confidential files, or messages.</p>

          <h4>How long does a link stay active?</h4>
          <p>By default, each link expires as soon as itâ€™s accessed once. You can also set custom expiration times.</p>

          <h4>Is my data stored on your servers?</h4>
          <p>No, your data is encrypted end-to-end and is never stored in a readable format on our servers.</p>

          <h4>How do I know my information is secure?</h4>
          <p>We use AES-256-GCM encryption, industry-standard security practices, and no external JavaScript to ensure maximum Gdpr and safety.</p>
